BAGES: A special award you can gift players when they meet a goal within your experience, 
       such as completing a difficult objective or playing for a certain amount of time.
       As soon as a player receives a badge,it displays within the Badges category of their inventory.
       *** Use a template of 512Ã—512 pixels.
 3 Useful method:
  - Awarding Badges: --> BadgeService:AwardBadge(player.UserId, badgeId)
  - Checking Earned Badges: --> BadgeService:UserHasBadgeAsync(player.UserId, BADGE_ID) => boolean
  - Getting Badge Info: --> BadgeService:GetBadgeInfoAsync(BADGE_ID) => table
